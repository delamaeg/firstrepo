Git (/ɡɪt/[5]) is a widely used source code management system for software development. It is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed,[6] data integrity,[7] and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.[8] Git was initially designed and developed in 2005 by Linux kernel developers (including Linus Torvalds) for Linux kernel development.[9]
As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server.[10] Like the Linux kernel, Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.




Git development began in April 2005, after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access to BitKeeper, a proprietary source control management (SCM) system that had previously been used to maintain the project.[11] The copyright holder of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy, had withdrawn gratis use of the product after claiming that Andrew Tridgell had reverse-engineered the BitKeeper protocols.[12]
Torvalds wanted a distributed system that he could use like BitKeeper, but none of the available free systems met his needs, particularly in terms of performance. Torvalds cited the example of a source control management system requiring thirty seconds to apply a patch and update all associated metadata, and noted that this would not scale to the needs of Linux kernel development, where syncing with fellow maintainers could require 250 such actions at a time. For his design criteria, he specified that patching should take no more than three seconds,[6] and these additional three points:
take Concurrent Versions System (CVS) as an example of what not to do; if in doubt, make the exact opposite decision[8]
support a distributed, BitKeeper-like workflow[8]
include very strong safeguards against corruption, either accidental or malicious.[7]
These criteria eliminated every then-existing version control system except Monotone. Performance considerations excluded this, too.[8] So immediately after the 2.6.12-rc2 Linux kernel development release, Torvalds set out to write his own.[8]
Torvalds quipped about the name git, which is British English slang meaning "unpleasant person": "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'."[13][14] The man page describes Git as "the stupid content tracker".[15] In the readme file of the source code it elaborates some more:[16]
